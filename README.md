# INFANT_CARE_ASSISTANT_

INFANT CARE ASSISTANT USING MACHINE LEARNING, IMAGE PROCESSING AND IOT.

Project aimed to showcase an Infant Care Assistant which employs IoT sensor network and Raspberry Pi to collect data on the current state of the infant and its surrounding and automation techniques for soothing a troubled infant and face recognition techniques used to detect the Infant expression. Storage of data is being done using private cloud servers and include a graphical user interface built using HTML5 and CSS. Expected results of proposed experiment may indicate that this assistant could ease some workload of parents and enable them to take utmost care of their infants. Tech used:- Python , Machine learning, Arduino. Soft Skills Time Management, Teamwork, Presentation, Report writing.
